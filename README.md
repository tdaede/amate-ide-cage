This is a PCB for the NEC PC-9821 A-Mate series hard drive caddies, e.g. the NEC PC-9821A-E07 or ICM INTER-340A.

The PCB is mechanically compatible, though note that the IDE cable is reversed comapred to the NEC board! NEC uses a ribbon cable with the connector crimped on backwards. This PCB is instead marked for a standard, straight through IDE cable. The connector can still be installed reversed if desired, or a right angle connector could be used for e.g. a CF card adapter.

Also note that the 74HCT157s are in a narrow SO package rather than the more common SOIC.
